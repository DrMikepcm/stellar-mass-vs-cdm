# stellar-mass-vs-cdm
This repo analyzes stellar mass near strong gravitational lenses versus Cold Dark Matter (CDM) predictions. It includes data, scripts, and results showing how observed stellar surface densities consistently challenge CDM thresholds across growing lens samples, highlighting potential gaps in dark matter models.
